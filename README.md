**Additional Items:**
The public warframe export doesn't include all the data you'd like, such as relays, so you can add them yourself.

 To do this:
  - Create a json file of type `Data_langcode.json` in the AdditionalData folder
  - View the example in the TemplateAdditionalJSON file
  - Add the data you want
  - Done

P.S. It already contains two files with some relays names in Russian and English

**Types:**
If you are using `Typescript`, there is a file for you in the @types folder describing all data types
